## Laravel Implementations

You can implement the payment functionality in two ways:

1. **Controller Method (Recommended)**
2. **Embedded (e.g., `pay.blade.php`)**

### Steps for Implementation

#### 1. Controller Method (Recommended)

1. **Create a Controller Method**

   Define a function in your controller to handle the payment logic. This ensures better code organization and reusability.

   ```php
   // Example in PayController.php
   public function handlePayment(Request $request)
   {
       // Payment handling logic
   }
